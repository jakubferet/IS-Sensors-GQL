# IS-Sensors-GQL
Information system for sensors created with Python FastAPI framework, GraphQL API, SQLAlchemy and Postgres database

First version of Sensor Information System created with FastAPI framework and GraphQL API.
Client side is unfinished - I switched to Flask framework and REST API.
For a complete version made with Flask and REST API, see https://github.com/jakubferet/IS-Sensors
